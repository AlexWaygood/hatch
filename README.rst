Hatch is a productivity tool designed to make your workflow easier and more
efficient, while also reducing the number of other tools you need to know.
It aims to make the 90% use cases as pleasant as possible.

For me personally, Hatch has entirely replaced the manual (or entire!)
use of these:

- `Cookiecutter PyPackage <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage>`_
- `virtualenv <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>`_
- `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_
- `Pew <https://github.com/berdario/pew>`_
- `inve <https://gist.github.com/datagrok/2199506>`_
- `pytest <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest>`_
- `Coverage.py <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>`_
- `twine <https://github.com/pypa/twine>`_
- `bumpversion <https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion>`_
- `Incremental <https://github.com/twisted/incremental>`_
- ``python setup.py ...``

Why use a plethora of disparate tools when most of the time only 1 is needed?!

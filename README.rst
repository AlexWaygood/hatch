Hatch is a productivity tool designed to make your workflow easier and more
efficient, while also reducing the number of other tools you need to know.
It aims to make the 90% use cases as pleasant as possible.

For me personally, Hatch has entirely replaced the manual (or entire!)
use of these:

- `Cookiecutter PyPackage <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage>`_
- `pip <https://github.com/pypa/pip>`_
- `virtualenv <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>`_
- `pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_
- `Pew <https://github.com/berdario/pew>`_
- `inve <https://gist.github.com/datagrok/2199506>`_
- `pytest`_
- `Coverage.py <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>`_
- `twine <https://github.com/pypa/twine>`_
- `bumpversion <https://github.com/peritus/bumpversion>`_
- `zest.releaser <https://github.com/zestsoftware/zest.releaser>`_
- `Incremental <https://github.com/twisted/incremental>`_
- ``python setup.py ...``

Installation
------------

Hatch is distributed on `PyPI`_ as a universal wheel and is available on
Linux/macOS and Windows and supports Python 3.5+ and PyPy.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install --user hatch

or simply ``pip`` if that already points to a Python 3 version.

If ``hatch`` doesn't work on your system immediately after that, please
run `this command <https://github.com/ofek/pybin#pybin-put>`_.

After the first installation, you may want to run ``hatch config --restore`` to
ensure your config file is available.

Commands
--------
